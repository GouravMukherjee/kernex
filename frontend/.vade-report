Vercel Web Analytics Integration for Next.js

SUMMARY:
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Kernex frontend Next.js project using the App Router architecture.

CHANGES MADE:

1. INSTALLED PACKAGE:
   - Added @vercel/analytics (version ^1.6.1) to dependencies using npm install @vercel/analytics
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json with new dependency

2. MODIFIED FILES:
   - frontend/src/app/layout.tsx:
     * Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
     * Added <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, placed after {children}
     * This ensures analytics tracking is enabled across all pages in the application

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- The project uses Next.js 14.2.35 with App Router (located at src/app/)
- Root layout is at frontend/src/app/layout.tsx
- The Analytics component was added to the root layout to ensure it's included in all pages

VERIFICATION:
✓ Build completed successfully without errors
✓ No linting issues introduced by the changes
✓ Package installation successful with no vulnerabilities
✓ Analytics component correctly integrated into the layout
✓ All existing code structure preserved

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
The Analytics component from @vercel/analytics/next was added to the root layout following Vercel's documentation for App Router projects. The component is placed inside the body tag after children, which is the recommended positioning for optimal tracking across all pages.
